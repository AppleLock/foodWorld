            <h2>Method</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Start by chopping up your mushroom and frying them in any oil you have at hand, butter also works at low heat. After they're done, set them aside in another plate, juices and all!</li>

                <li>Dice up your onion, and start frying it in olive oil in a bit pot or even a work pan, we want to sweat the onions until they start to form a yellow layer.</li>

                <li>While the onions are sweating put 1L of water to boil for your chicken stock if you're using a cube. If you stock is premade no need to heat it and this step can be skipped.</li>
                
                <li>Once the onions start to yellow throw in the rice and fry it for a bit with the onions around 1-2min.</li>

                <li>Slowly pour all your wine in to the pot and let it simmer and be consumed and enveloped by the rice.</li>

                <li>As they wine begans to evaporate start pouring your stock in ladle batches on to your rice. You will be repeating this step until the rice is cooked aldente and is ready to be served.</li>

                <li>As your rice thickens and tastes good to your preference add the 150g of shredded cheese and 50g of butter in batches. Mix well.</li>

                <li>Throw your mushrooms you have set aside earlier and mix again.</li>

                <li>Your meal is ready to be enjoyed, serve it up with some fresh parsley and dig in!</li>
