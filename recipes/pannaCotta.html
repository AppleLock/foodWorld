            <h2>Method</h2>

            <ol>
                <li> Soak the gelatin in a bowl with the cold water for about 10/15 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the heavy cream in a saucepan.</li>

                <li>Cut the vanilla bean along its length and remove the seeds by scraping with the tip of a knife, then add it to the cream.</li>

                <li>Finally add 60 g of sugar. Cook over low heat, but without boiling (about 10/15 min); then when the cream has come to a boil, turn off the heat and remove the vanilla bean.</li>

                <li>Place the cream in a bowl. Now drain the gelatin without squeezing too much, then dip it in the bowl with the hot cream. Stir with a whisk until the gelatin has completely melted. Panna cotta is almost ready; now you just have to pour the cream in some glasses or cups and let it cool. Let see how to do it!</li>

                <li>Take four glasses and moisten with cold water then drain them. Place them in a container where in the center you have put a rolled towel. Lean the glasses so that they remain sloped (this only if you want the panna cotta to solidify sloped). Pour the panna cotta cream into the glasses. Leave to cool off at room temperature then cover with plastic wrap and place them in the refrigerator to make it cold for at least 6 hours. After this cooling time, panna cotta is ready to be enjoyed. Now we keep going to explain how to make a delicious raspberry sauce to top the panna cotta.</li>

                <h2>Raspberry sauce</h2>

                <li>Place the raspberries in a food processor then add 60 g (about 2 oz) of white sugar and the juice of 1 lemon. Grind the raspberries until you get a fairly homogeneous sauce.</li>

                <li>Using a strainer filter the raspberry sauce and place it in a saucepan then warm it over very low heat until the sugar has melted (about 5 min).</li>

                <li>Place the raspberry sauce on top of panna cotta before serving.</li>
