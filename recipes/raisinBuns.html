            <h2>Method</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Begin by combining lukewarm milk, 2 tablespoons flour (from the 260 g (2 cups + 2 tablespoons/ 9 oz)), 1 tablespoon sugar (from 2 tablespoons sugar) and yeast in a jar. Whisk well and let the mixture stand for 5 minutes.</li>

                <li>In the meantime combine the remaining flour, the remaining sugar, egg and salt in a large bowl. Pour over the yeast – sugar mixture. Start mixing, while adding the melted butter. Knead the dough very well, until you see bubbles in the dough.</li>

                <li>Cover with cling film and then with kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until dough has doubled in size. After 1 hour remove the dough from the bowl and put it on a working surface. Carefully fold and press the raisins into the dough and shape it into a long baguette form. You want to retain the air bubbles in the dough intact so that you’ll have nicely fluffy buns. Cut the baguette roll into approximately 8 equal rolls. Cut the roll in the middle first, it makes it easier to cut the rest of the rolls. Form the rolls into buns and put them on a baking sheet lined with a parchment paper. Cover and let raise for another 30 minutes.</li>

                <li>In the meantime preheat the oven to 180°C with both up and low heat. After 30 minutes brush the raisin yeast rolls with a beaten egg.</li>

                <li>Bake for 20 minutes or until nicely golden brown. Remove from the oven and enjoy!</li>
